## Overview of Analysis
We will be using Tableau to manipulate data, in order to create a business proposal for a bike-sharing in Des Moines. The available document consists of rider’s data for the month of August in New York City. For the purpose of our analysis, we will focus on making a distinction of subscribers vs non-subscribers, genders and focusing our attention on usage patterns. The results will allow us address investors and persuade them to invest in our project.
